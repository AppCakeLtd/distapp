                <p>Our commitment to privacy and data protection is reflected in this Privacy Statement which
                    describes how we collect and process “personal information” that identifies you, like your name
                    or email address. Any other information besides this is "non-personal information." If we store
                    personal information with non-personal information, we'll consider that combination to be
                    personal information.</p>
